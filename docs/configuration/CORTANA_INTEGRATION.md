# Cortana Voice Assistant Integration

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced Cortana Voice Assistant integration for the Weather
Dashboard, implementing Bot Framework-inspired patterns and advanced Natural Language
Understanding (NLU) capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **VoiceCommandProcessor** - Advanced NLU engine with entity extraction and intent classification
2. **CortanaVoiceService** - Main service implementing ICortanaVoiceService interface
3. **Bot Framework Patterns** - Conversation context management and dialog flows
4. **Azure Speech Integration** - Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities (placeholder)

### Key Features

- **Advanced NLU**: Intent classification with confidence scoring
- **Entity Extraction**: Location, time, and weather parameter recognition
- **Conversation Context**: Multi-turn dialog support with context preservation
- **Voice Profiles**: Multiple voice options with customizable speech settings
- **Caching**: Performance optimization for frequent queries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

## Implementation Details

### Voice Command Processor

```python
from src.services.voice_command_processor import VoiceCommandProcessor

# Initialize with services
processor = VoiceCommandProcessor(
    weather_service=weather_service,
    cache_service=cache_service,
    storage_service=storage_service
)

# Process commands with context
response = await processor.process_command(
    "What's the weather like tomorrow in Seattle?",
    context={"user_location": "Portland"}
)
```

### Cortana Voice Service

```python
from src.services.cortana_voice_service import create_cortana_voice_service

# Create service with dependencies
cortana = create_cortana_voice_service(
    weather_service=weather_service,
    cache_service=cache_service,
    storage_service=storage_service
)

# Process voice commands
response = await cortana.process_voice_command(
    "Get me the forecast for London"
)

# Configure voice settings
await cortana.configure_voice_settings({
    "voice_profile": "en-GB_Standard",
    "speech_rate": 1.2,
    "speech_volume": 0.9
})
```

## Supported Commands

### Weather Queries

- "What's the weather in [city]?"
- "Get current weather for [location]"
- "How's the weather today?"
- "What's the temperature in [city]?"

### Forecast Requests

- "Get forecast for [city]"
- "What's the weather like tomorrow?"
- "Show me the 5-day forecast"
- "Will it rain this weekend?"

### Location Management

- "Set my default location to [city]"
- "Change my location to [city]"
- "What's my current location?"

### Help and Information

- "Help"
- "What can you do?"
- "Show me available commands"

## Configuration

### Voice Profiles

Available voice profiles:

- `en-US_Standard` - US English (default)
- `en-US_Neural` - US English with neural voice
- `en-GB_Standard` - British English
- `en-AU_Standard` - Australian English
- `en-CA_Standard` - Canadian English

### Speech Settings

- **Speech Rate**: 0.5 - 2.0 (default: 1.0)
- **Speech Volume**: 0.0 - 1.0 (default: 0.8)
- **Speech Pitch**: -1.0 - 1.0 (default: 0.0)

## Bot Framework Patterns

### Intent Classification

```python
class CommandType(Enum):
    CURRENT_WEATHER = "current_weather"
    FORECAST = "forecast"
    HOURLY_WEATHER = "hourly_weather"
    SET_LOCATION = "set_location"
    HELP = "help"
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"
```

### Entity Extraction

- **Location entities**: City names, regions, countries
- **Time entities**: "today", "tomorrow", "this weekend", specific dates
- **Weather parameters**: "temperature", "humidity", "wind", "precipitation"

### Conversation Context

```python
# Context preservation across turns
context = {
    "previous_location": "Seattle",
    "previous_command": "weather",
    "user_preferences": {
        "default_location": "Portland",
        "temperature_unit": "celsius"
    }
}
```

## Testing

Run the integration test to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_cortana_integration.py
```

The test covers:

- Basic voice command processing
- Conversation context management
- Voice settings configuration
- Speech synthesis capabilities
- Backward compatibility

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

- Falls back to text responses if TTS fails
- Provides suggestions for unrecognized commands
- Handles network timeouts gracefully
- Maintains conversation state during errors

### User-Friendly Messages

- Clear error explanations
- Helpful suggestions for command correction
- Context-aware error responses

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Weather data cached for 5 minutes
- User preferences cached for 1 hour
- Voice synthesis results cached for 24 hours

### Response Time Targets

- Voice command processing: < 2 seconds
- Weather data retrieval: < 1 second
- Speech synthesis: < 3 seconds

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data logged in voice interactions
- User preferences encrypted in storage
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Input validation for all voice commands

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Azure Speech Services Integration**
   - Real STT/TTS implementation
   - Custom voice models
   - Noise cancellation

2. **Advanced NLU**
   - LUIS integration
   - Custom entity recognition
   - Sentiment analysis

3. **Multi-language Support**
   - Spanish, French, German voices
   - Localized weather responses
   - Cultural date/time formatting

4. **Proactive Notifications**
   - Weather alerts
   - Daily briefings
   - Severe weather warnings

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- asyncio for async operations
- typing for type hints
- logging for diagnostics
- pathlib for file operations

## Integration Points

### Weather Service Interface

```python
class IWeatherAPI:
    async def get_current_weather_async(self, location: str) -> CurrentWeather
    async def get_forecast_async(self, location: str, days: int) -> WeatherForecast
```

### Cache Service Interface

```python
class ICacheService:
    async def get_async(self, key: str) -> Any
    async def set_async(self, key: str, value: Any, ttl: int) -> None
```

### Storage Service Interface

```python
class IStorageService:
    async def store_user_preference_async(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None
    async def get_user_preference_async(self, key: str) -> Any
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Logging

- Command processing metrics
- Error rates and types
- Response time tracking
- User interaction patterns

### Health Checks

- Service availability monitoring
- API endpoint health
- Cache performance metrics
- Speech service connectivity

## Conclusion

The enhanced Cortana Voice Assistant provides a robust, scalable foundation for voice-enabled weather interactions. The Bot Framework-inspired architecture ensures maintainability and extensibility while delivering a superior user experience through advanced NLU and conversation management capabilities.
