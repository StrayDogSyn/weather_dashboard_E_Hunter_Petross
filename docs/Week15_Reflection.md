## Status Update

Feature 2 (City Comparison) and Feature 3 (Weather Journal) are fully implemented and integrated into the application. The personal enhancement—an advanced glassmorphic UI and analytics dashboard—is over halfway finished, with all major components functional and ongoing work focused on visual polish and user experience. There are currently no significant blockers; the remaining tasks include refining chart interactivity and enhancing accessibility. Feedback on UI clarity, dashboard usability, or any other aspect is welcome as I work toward final completion next week.
