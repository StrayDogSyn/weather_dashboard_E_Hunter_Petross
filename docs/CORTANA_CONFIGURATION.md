# Cortana Voice Assistant Configuration

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Cortana voice assistant configuration that has been set up for the Weather Dashboard project. The configuration follows best practices for voice assistants and provides a flexible framework for customization.

## Configuration Structure

The Cortana configuration is stored in the `configs/cortana/` directory and consists of the following files:

- `manifest.yaml`: The main configuration file in YAML format
- `schema.json`: JSON Schema for validating the configuration
- `config_manager.py`: Python utility for managing and validating configuration
- `test_config.py`: Test script for validating the configuration manager
- `README.md`: Documentation file

## Configuration Sections

The configuration is organized into the following sections:

1. **Voice Configuration**: Settings for the text-to-speech engine
   - Voice profile: `en-GB_Standard`
   - Speech rate and pitch adjustments

2. **Personality Configuration**: Traits and response style settings
   - Personality traits: `professional`, `helpful`, `concise`
   - Response style: `conversational`
   - Humor level: `medium`

3. **Privacy Settings**: Data collection and retention policies
   - Privacy mode: `enabled`
   - Data retention: `30 days`
   - Query anonymization: `enabled`
   - Telemetry: `disabled`

4. **Logging Configuration**: Log levels and file settings
   - Log level: `DEBUG`
   - Log file: `cortana.log`
   - Log rotation settings

5. **System Integrations**: External system connections
   - Enabled: `calendar`, `email`
   - Disabled: `home-automation`, `social-media`

6. **Security Configuration**: OAuth scopes and authentication settings
   - Security scopes: `calendar.read`, `email.read`, `user.profile.basic`
   - Authentication method: `oauth2`
   - Token refresh interval: `24 hours`

7. **Deployment Configuration**: Environment and update settings
   - Environment: `staging`
   - Update channel: `stable`
   - Auto-update: `enabled`
   - Backup before update: `enabled`

8. **Performance Tuning**: Cache and timeout settings
   - Cache size: `100 MB`
   - Max concurrent requests: `5`
   - Request timeout: `30 seconds`
   - Offline mode support: `enabled`

## Security Audit

The configuration manager performs a security audit on the requested scopes to ensure they follow the principle of least privilege. High-risk scopes are flagged with warnings, and overly broad scopes are rejected.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The `config_manager.py` script provides a command-line interface for managing the configuration:

```bash
# View current configuration and validation report
python configs/cortana/config_manager.py --output-report

# Update configuration settings
python configs/cortana/config_manager.py --voice-profile en-GB_Standard --personality-traits professional helpful concise --enable-privacy-mode --log-level DEBUG --deploy-environment staging --output-report
```

### Programmatic Usage

You can also use the `ConfigManager` class in your Python code:

```python
from configs.cortana.config_manager import ConfigManager

# Initialize config manager
config_manager = ConfigManager()

# Update configuration
user_inputs = {
    "voice": {
        "profile": "en-GB_Standard"
    },
    "personality": {
        "traits": ["professional", "helpful", "concise"]
    },
    "privacy": {
        "enable_privacy_mode": True
    }
}
config_manager.update_config(user_inputs)

# Validate and save configuration
config_manager.validate()
config_manager.save()
```

## Best Practices

The Cortana configuration follows these best practices:

1. **Security**: Uses the principle of least privilege for security scopes
2. **Privacy**: Restricts data collection to on-device only
3. **Personality**: Uses well-defined personality traits to shape Cortana's tone
4. **Logging**: Uses appropriate log levels for different environments
5. **Validation**: Validates configuration before deployment

## Integration with Weather Dashboard

To integrate Cortana with the Weather Dashboard application, you can import the `ConfigManager` class and use it to load the Cortana configuration. This will allow the Weather Dashboard to use Cortana's voice assistant capabilities for features such as:

- Voice-based weather queries
- Reading weather forecasts aloud
- Setting weather alerts
- Managing favorite cities via voice commands

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the Cortana configuration include:

1. Adding support for additional voice profiles
2. Implementing more sophisticated security auditing
3. Adding support for custom wake words
4. Implementing voice recognition for user authentication
5. Adding support for additional languages

## Conclusion

The Cortana voice assistant configuration provides a solid foundation for integrating voice capabilities into the Weather Dashboard application. It follows best practices for security, privacy, and usability, and provides a flexible framework for customization.
