## ‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

### Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?

‚Ä¢ **Professional Standards**: Capstone projects should demonstrate industry-level code quality with proper architecture, documentation, and testing
‚Ä¢ **Feature Integration**: The project should showcase multiple interconnected features rather than isolated functionalities
‚Ä¢ **User Experience Focus**: Beyond technical implementation, the project must provide genuine value and usability to end users
‚Ä¢ **Portfolio Ready**: The final product should be something I'm proud to showcase to potential employers or clients

### Concept Connections: Which Week 1‚Äì10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?

**Strongest Skills:**
‚Ä¢ **Object-Oriented Programming**: Comfortable with classes, inheritance, and encapsulation patterns
‚Ä¢ **API Integration**: Successfully implemented OpenWeatherMap API with proper error handling and rate limiting
‚Ä¢ **GUI Development**: TKinter proficiency with custom styling and responsive design
‚Ä¢ **Project Structure**: Organized codebase following clean architecture principles

**Need More Practice:**
‚Ä¢ **Advanced Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development approaches
‚Ä¢ **Database Integration**: While I have file storage, SQL database skills could be stronger
‚Ä¢ **Performance Optimization**: Profiling code and optimizing for better performance under load
‚Ä¢ **Async Programming**: Handling concurrent operations and non-blocking API calls more effectively

### Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?

‚Ä¢ **API Rate Limiting**: Managing OpenWeatherMap's rate limits while providing responsive user experience
‚Ä¢ **Data Persistence**: Ensuring user data (favorites, journal entries) persists reliably across sessions
‚Ä¢ **GUI Responsiveness**: Preventing the interface from freezing during API calls or data processing

### Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?

‚Ä¢ **Office Hours Topics**: Advanced testing strategies, database integration best practices, and deployment guidance
‚Ä¢ **Code Review Sessions**: Getting feedback on architecture decisions and code quality improvements
‚Ä¢ **Resource Utilization**: Python documentation, TKinter advanced tutorials, and software architecture patterns
‚Ä¢ **Peer Learning**: Discussing implementation approaches with other fellows working on similar projects
