## ✍️ Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

### Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?

• **Professional Standards**: Capstone projects should demonstrate industry-level code quality with proper architecture, documentation, and testing
• **Feature Integration**: The project should showcase multiple interconnected features rather than isolated functionalities  
• **User Experience Focus**: Beyond technical implementation, the project must provide genuine value and usability to end users
• **Portfolio Ready**: The final product should be something I'm proud to showcase to potential employers or clients
• **Clean Code Principles**: Following SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns makes the codebase maintainable and extensible

### Concept Connections: Which Week 1–10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?

**Strongest Skills:**
• **Object-Oriented Programming**: Comfortable with classes, inheritance, and encapsulation patterns
• **API Integration**: Successfully implemented OpenWeatherMap API with proper error handling and rate limiting
• **File I/O Operations**: Solid understanding of reading/writing data in various formats (JSON, TXT, CSV)
• **GUI Development**: TKinter proficiency with custom styling and responsive design
• **Project Structure**: Organized codebase following clean architecture principles

**Need More Practice:**
• **Advanced Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development approaches
• **Database Integration**: While I have file storage, SQL database skills could be stronger
• **Performance Optimization**: Profiling code and optimizing for better performance under load
• **Async Programming**: Handling concurrent operations and non-blocking API calls more effectively

### Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?

• **API Rate Limiting**: Managing OpenWeatherMap's rate limits while providing responsive user experience
• **Data Persistence**: Ensuring user data (favorites, journal entries) persists reliably across sessions
• **GUI Responsiveness**: Preventing the interface from freezing during API calls or data processing
• **Configuration Management**: Properly handling environment variables and API keys across different deployment scenarios

### Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?

• **Office Hours Topics**: Advanced testing strategies, database integration best practices, and deployment guidance
• **Code Review Sessions**: Getting feedback on architecture decisions and code quality improvements
• **Resource Utilization**: Python documentation, TKinter advanced tutorials, and software architecture patterns
• **Peer Learning**: Discussing implementation approaches with other fellows working on similar projects
