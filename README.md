## 🏗️ Architecture

This project implements Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **`src/models/`** - Domain entities and value objects
- **`src/core/`** - Business logic and use cases
- **`src/services/`** - External service integrations
- **`src/interfaces/`** - Abstract interfaces for dependency inversion
- **`src/config/`** - Configuration management
- **`src/ui/`** - User interface layer
- **`src/utils/`** - Utility functions and helpers

## 🧪 Testing

Testing framework setup is ready for future implementation:

```bash
# Install testing dependencies (when needed)
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run tests (when test suite is implemented)
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

# Check code quality
flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503,F401,F541,E501,E402,F841
mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports

# Run all checks together
python -c "
import subprocess
import sys

commands = [
    ['black', '--check', 'src/', 'tests/'],
    ['isort', '--check-only', 'src/', 'tests/'],
    ['flake8', 'src/', 'tests/', '--max-line-length=88', '--extend-ignore=E203,W503,F401,F541,E501,E402,F841'],
    ['mypy', 'src/', '--ignore-missing-imports']
]

for cmd in commands:
    print(f'Running: {\" \".join(cmd)}')
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f'❌ Failed: {\" \".join(cmd)}')
        print(result.stdout)
