   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to `.env`

3. **Run Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   OR use VS Code task: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Run Weather Dashboard"

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Notes
