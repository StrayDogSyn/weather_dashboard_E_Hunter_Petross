3. **✅ First Workflow Test Successful**
   - Quick Test workflow triggered via CLI
   - Workflow run ID: 1593827... (in progress)

4. **✅ Complete Testing Infrastructure Ready**
   - Batch script (`test-workflows.bat`) for easy testing
   - Comprehensive documentation (`WORKFLOW_SETUP.md`)
   - Multiple trigger methods available

### 🎯 Ready-to-Use Commands

**Quick Tests:**
```powershell
# Basic validation
gh workflow run quick-test.yml --ref main -f test_type=basic

# Full test suite
gh workflow run quick-test.yml --ref main -f test_type=full

# Integration tests
gh workflow run quick-test.yml --ref main -f test_type=integration
```

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
```powershell
# Development environment
gh workflow run ci-cd.yml --ref main -f test_environment=development

# Staging environment
gh workflow run ci-cd.yml --ref main -f test_environment=staging
```

**Monitoring:**
```powershell
# List recent runs
gh run list

# Watch specific workflow
gh run list --workflow="quick-test.yml"

# Watch live progress
gh run watch
```

### 📊 Testing Methods Available

1. **Command Line Interface** ⭐ (Recommended)
   ```powershell
   gh workflow run WORKFLOW.yml --ref BRANCH
   ```

2. **Interactive Batch Script**
   ```powershell
   .\test-workflows.bat
   ```

3. **GitHub Web Interface**
   - Go to repository → Actions → Run workflow

4. **Git Push Triggers**
   ```powershell
   git push origin main  # Auto-triggers CI/CD
   ```

5. **Pull Request Triggers**
   - Create PR → Auto-triggers PR validation

### 🔄 Continuous Integration Features
